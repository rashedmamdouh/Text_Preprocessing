# Text Processing Project

## Overview

This project focuses on text data preprocessing for NLP tasks. It covers tasks like data retrieval, cleaning, normalization, tokenization, and stemming/lemmatization.

## Capturing Text Data

### Plain Text
- Read plain text from a file.

### Tabular Data
- Extract and lowercase text from a CSV file.

### Online Resource
- Fetch data from a REST API.

## Cleaning

- Remove HTML tags using RegEx and Beautiful Soup.
- Eliminate punctuation and special characters.

## Normalization

### Case Normalization
- Convert text to lowercase.

### Punctuation Removal
- Remove punctuation characters.

## Tokenization

- Split text into words and sentences.
- Utilize NLTK for tokenization.

## Stopwords Removal

- Remove common stop words.

## Sentence Parsing

- Define a custom grammar for sentence parsing.

## Stemming & Lemmatization

### Stemming
- Reduce words to their stems using Porter Stemmer.

### Lemmatization
- Reduce words to their root form using WordNet Lemmatizer.
- Lemmatize verbs with specified parts of speech (POS).

## Running the Code in Jupyter Notebook

To run the code for the Text Processing Project in a Jupyter Notebook environment, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine. If you haven't already installed them, you can do so using Anaconda or by running the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. **Download the Project**: Clone or download the project's repository from the project's source, such as GitHub.

3. **Navigate to the Project Folder**: Open your terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder where you've downloaded or cloned the project.

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**: In your terminal, run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   This will open a new tab in your web browser displaying the Jupyter Notebook interface.

5. **Open the Project Notebook**: In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the project folder and locate the project's notebook file (e.g., "Text_Processing_Project.ipynb"). Click on it to open the notebook.

6. **Execute Cells**: Inside the notebook, you'll see the project's code organized into cells. Execute each cell sequentially by selecting a cell and clicking the "Run" button or by using the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter. Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook to understand the process.

7. **Interact with the Code**: Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different settings as needed. Jupyter Notebook allows you to interactively run and modify code cells.

8. **Save Your Work**: You can save your changes in the notebook as you work through it. Use the "File" menu in Jupyter Notebook to save your progress.

9. **Completion**: Once you've completed the code and any necessary modifications, you can close the Jupyter Notebook tab in your browser. You may also want to save a final copy of the notebook for reference.

By following these steps, you can effectively run and interact with the Text Processing Project code within a Jupyter Notebook environment, allowing you to explore and understand the text data preprocessing tasks for NLP tasks covered in the project.
